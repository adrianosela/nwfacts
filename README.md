## Motivation

All humans are susceptible to a large number of well-understood [congnitive biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases). These biases ultimately impact how we see and understand the world. NWFacts aims to empower everyone to browse breaking news while scoring their sources for measured bias.
